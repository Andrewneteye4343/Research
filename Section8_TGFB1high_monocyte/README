TGFB1 high expression monocyte 
=========================================================================
To identfy the GAS6-receiving monocyte population, we utilized TGFB1, which is induced by GAS6 treatment in previous fibrosis-related research, as the important gene indicator of these monocytes.
GSE171524, GSE155249 and GSE149878 were utilized in this section.
