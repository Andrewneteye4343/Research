scRNA and snRNA Data Process
==========================================================================
These data can be download from NCBI GEO website with their accession number
GSE171524: COVID-19 lung snRNA
GSE155249: COVID-19 BAL scRNA
GSE149878: COVID-19 lung scRNA
GSE188172: COVID-19 PBMC scRNA
GSE216704: COVID-19 BAL scRNA
GSE128033: IPF BAL scRNA
