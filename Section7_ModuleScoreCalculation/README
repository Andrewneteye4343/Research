Module Score Calculation
=========================================================================
To identify cell population and evaluate the cell phenotype, we conducted AddModuleScore() function to calculate the module score in each interested cluster.
For profibrotic macrophage, we used CD9, TREM2, SPP1, LGMN, GPNMB, FABP5, CD63, and CD163 as gene member in the signature.
GSE171524, GSE155249 and GSE149878 were utilized in this section.
