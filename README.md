# Brief Description
These codes were used for data analysis and drug discovery in our research. Our research focus on investigating the mechanism of profibrotic macrophage differentiation in post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis with multi-omics data. To deeply explore the cellular and molecular patterns, we analyzed across distinct data type, including single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA), single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA), spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA sequencing data. Besides COVID-19, we also investigated other lung injury diseases for identifying COVID-19-specific regulatory machanisms that influence profibrotic macrophage differentiation, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and tuberculosis (TB). Our analysis process can be simply seperated into 12 sections, from data process to drug disovery. The detailed codes have been recorded in the indivdual directory.
