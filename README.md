# Description
These codes were used for data analysis in our research. Our research focus on investigating the mechanism of profibrotic macrophage differentiation in post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis with multi-omics data. To deeply explore the cellular and molecular patterns, we analyzed across distinct data type, including single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA), single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA), spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA sequencing data. Besides COVID-19, we also investigated other lung injury disease for identifying COVID-19-specific regulatory machanisms that influence profibrotic macrophage differentiation, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and tuberculosis (TB).
