Molecular Docking Simulation
=========================================================================
This is one of the drug discovery strategies in our study.
In this section, we predict the binding affinity of compounds from Taiwan Health Insurance library.
The stronger binding affinity reveals the more possibility to block GAS6 from TAM receptor binding and stop the signaling transduction.
