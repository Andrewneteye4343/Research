GAS6+ Plasma cell
=========================================================================
To identify the COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis-associated plasma cell, we overlapper the top200 highly expressed genes in GAS6+ plasma cells from thress datasets.
The overlapped 54 common genes are considered the GAS6+ plasma cell signature.
GSE171524, GSE155249 and GSE149878 were utilized in this section.
